              Passive income (or unearned income, as itâ€™s classified by the
              Internal Revenue Service) is defined as income that requires
              minimal work to generate and maintain, coming from somewhere other
              than a traditional employer. Passive income streams can come from
              investing in mutual funds or real estate, selling products online,
              publishing online courses, or other side hustles in which the
              earner doesn't have to actively participate. Unlike active income,
              passive income is often generated automatically, providing
              residual income with minimal time and effort.
